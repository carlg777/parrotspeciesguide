# Essential Nutrition for Parrots

Proper nutrition is the foundation of parrot health and longevity. A balanced diet not only prevents disease but also supports vibrant plumage, strong immune function, and optimal energy levels. Understanding what to feed your parrot—and in what proportions—is one of the most important responsibilities of parrot ownership.

## The Foundation: Pelleted Diets

**High-quality pellets should comprise 50-70% of your parrot's daily diet.** Unlike seed mixes, pellets are nutritionally complete and formulated to provide balanced vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients. Choose organic, dye-free pellets from reputable manufacturers such as Harrison's, TOP's, or Roudybush.

Pellets prevent selective eating, a common problem with seed-only diets where parrots pick their favorite seeds and miss essential nutrients. When transitioning to pellets, do so gradually over 2-3 weeks by mixing increasing amounts with their current food. Monitor weight during transition to ensure your parrot is eating adequately.

For species-specific recommendations: smaller parrots like budgies and cockatiels need mini or small-sized pellets, while macaws and cockatoos require large pellets. Always check the manufacturer's feeding guidelines based on your bird's weight.

## Fresh Vegetables and Fruits: The Colorful Component

**Fresh produce should make up 20-30% of the daily diet.** Dark leafy greens like kale, collard greens, and dandelion greens are nutritional powerhouses rich in calcium and vitamin A. Rotate vegetables daily to provide variety: broccoli, carrots, bell peppers (all colors), sweet potato, butternut squash, and green beans are excellent choices.

Fruits should be offered in moderation—no more than 10% of total diet—due to high sugar content. Berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries), apple slices, pomegranate, mango, and papaya are healthy options. **Always remove seeds and pits** from fruits, as many contain trace toxins.

Wash all produce thoroughly and offer it fresh each morning. Remove uneaten fresh food after 2-4 hours to prevent bacterial growth, especially in warm climates.

## Seeds and Nuts: Treats, Not Staples

**Seeds and nuts should comprise no more than 10% of the diet.** While parrots love them, seeds are high in fat and low in essential nutrients. Use them primarily as training rewards and occasional treats.

Healthy options include almonds, walnuts, pecans, sunflower seeds (in moderation), and pumpkin seeds. Avoid peanuts unless specifically labeled "human-grade" and thoroughly inspected, as they can harbor aflatoxin mold that's deadly to birds. Always offer nuts in-shell when possible to provide enrichment through foraging behavior.

## Foods to Avoid: Critical Safety Information

Never feed your parrot these toxic foods:

- **Avocado** - Contains persin, which is fatal to birds even in small amounts
- **Chocolate** - Theobromine causes hyperactivity, seizures, and death
- **Caffeine** - Coffee, tea, and energy drinks are highly toxic
- **Salt** - Even small amounts can cause dehydration and kidney damage
- **Alcohol** - Extremely toxic to birds' small systems
- **Onions and garlic** - Can cause anemia and digestive issues
- **Apple seeds, cherry pits, peach pits** - Contain cyanide compounds

Additionally, avoid highly processed human foods, fried items, dairy products (birds are lactose intolerant), and anything containing artificial sweeteners, especially xylitol.

## Feeding Schedule and Portions

Feed your parrot twice daily—morning and early evening—mimicking natural foraging patterns. Remove uneaten fresh food after 2-4 hours, but pellets can remain available throughout the day. Provide fresh, clean water at all times, changing it at least twice daily.

Portion sizes vary by species: a budgie needs about 1-1.5 tablespoons of food daily, while a large macaw may consume 1/2 to 3/4 cup. Monitor your bird's weight weekly; you should be able to feel the keel bone with slight padding but not see it protruding sharply.

## Special Considerations

**During molting**, increase protein through extra legumes, quinoa, and small amounts of cooked egg. **Breeding pairs** need calcium supplementation through cuttlebone or mineral blocks. **Senior parrots** (15+ years) may benefit from softer foods and easier-to-digest options like lightly steamed vegetables.

Always consult an avian veterinarian before making major dietary changes, especially if your parrot has health conditions or is on medication. Regular veterinary checkups should include weight monitoring and nutritional assessments to ensure your feeding program meets your individual bird's needs.
