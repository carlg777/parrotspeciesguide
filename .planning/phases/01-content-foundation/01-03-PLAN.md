<objective>
Enhance 3 sample species profiles with enriched care data to demonstrate new schema capabilities and establish content quality standard.

Purpose: Create exemplary species profiles that showcase the depth and quality that will make these "best on the web". These samples become the template for future bulk content enhancement.
Output: 3 fully enhanced species JSON files (Cockatiel, Blue-and-Gold Macaw, Green-Cheeked Conure) with all new optional fields populated, ready for user verification.

**New schema fields from Plan 01**:
- `lifespan`: Expected lifespan in years
- `careLevel`: enum['beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced']
- `activityLevel`: Energy and activity description
- `socialNeeds`: Socialization requirements
- `noiseTolerance`: Guidance on noise expectations
- `spaceRequirements`: Detailed space needs
- `timeCommitment`: Daily time investment

**Sample species chosen**:
1. Cockatiel - Popular beginner species (small, beginner-friendly)
2. Blue-and-Gold Macaw - Large parrot (advanced care level)
3. Green-Cheeked Conure - Mid-size (intermediate, popular)

**Quality standard**: Information should be practical, specific, and actionable for prospective owners. Focus on realistic expectations rather than idealized descriptions.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Enhance Cockatiel profile with rich care data</name>
  <files>src/content/species/cockatiel.json</files>
  <action>
Add new optional fields to existing cockatiel.json:

- `lifespan`: "15-25 years with proper care (average 18-20 years)"
- `careLevel`: "beginner"
- `activityLevel`: "Moderate activity level. Enjoys playing, climbing, and exploring but also content with quiet time. Benefits from 2-3 hours outside cage daily for exercise and interaction."
- `socialNeeds`: "Highly social and bond strongly with owners. Prefer companionship of humans or other cockatiels. Can develop behavioral issues if left alone for long periods. Thrive with daily interaction and gentle handling."
- `noiseTolerance`: "Moderate noise level suitable for apartments if neighbors are tolerant. Vocal periods at dawn/dusk (flock calling). Whistling and chirping throughout day. Not screeching like larger parrots, but persistent vocalizations can be noticeable."
- `spaceRequirements`: "Minimum cage 24\"W × 18\"D × 24\"H for single bird. Larger is better - 36\" width ideal. Needs space for toys, perches at varying heights, and room to spread wings. Benefits from play gym or bird tree for out-of-cage time."
- `timeCommitment`: "1-2 hours daily minimum for interaction, training, and supervised out-of-cage time. Additional time for cage cleaning (10-15 min daily spot-clean, 30 min weekly deep-clean) and food preparation."

Keep all existing 11 fields unchanged. Ensure valid JSON formatting (proper comma placement, no trailing commas). Use double quotes for strings.

  <verify>Valid JSON structure, npm run astro check passes, species page rebuilds without errors</verify>
  <done>Cockatiel profile enhanced with all 7 new fields, content is detailed and practical</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Enhance additional sample species profiles</name>
  <files>src/content/species/blue-and-gold-macaw.json, src/content/species/green-cheeked-conure.json</files>
  <action>
For blue-and-gold-macaw.json, add:
- `lifespan`: "30-50+ years (some live 70+ years with excellent care)"
- `careLevel`: "advanced"
- `activityLevel`: "High energy and very active. Requires extensive daily exercise, climbing, and foraging activities. Needs 4-5 hours out-of-cage time for physical and mental stimulation. Destructive if under-stimulated."
- `socialNeeds`: "Extremely social and demanding. Forms intense bonds requiring substantial daily interaction. Can become aggressive or develop severe behavioral problems without consistent socialization. Not suitable for owners with limited time."
- `noiseTolerance`: "Extremely loud - unsuitable for apartments or noise-sensitive settings. Ear-piercing screams that carry long distances. Vocalizes primarily morning/evening but can be noisy throughout day when excited. Neighbors within 100+ feet will hear."
- `spaceRequirements`: "Large cage minimum 48\"W × 36\"D × 60\"H. Needs heavy-duty construction (14-gauge wire or thicker). Requires dedicated bird room or very large space. Play stand and multiple perches essential. Will destroy furniture and belongings if not properly managed."
- `timeCommitment`: "3-4 hours daily minimum for interaction, training, exercise, and enrichment. Extensive time for cage maintenance, food prep (fresh chop daily), and behavioral management. Lifetime commitment spanning decades."

For green-cheeked-conure.json, add:
- `lifespan`: "15-30 years with quality care (average 20-25 years)"
- `careLevel`: "intermediate"
- `activityLevel`: "High energy and playful. Loves climbing, swinging, and interactive toys. Needs 2-3 hours outside cage for exercise and bonding. More active and mischievous than cockatiels but more manageable than larger parrots."
- `socialNeeds`: "Very social and affectionate. Enjoys close contact and cuddling. Can bond strongly to one person but socializes well with others if introduced properly. Tolerates alone time better than larger parrots but still needs daily interaction."
- `noiseTolerance`: "Relatively quiet for a conure. Occasional loud calls but not constant screeching. Morning/evening vocalizations. Apartment-suitable if neighbors are reasonable. Quieter than sun conures or larger parrots."
- `spaceRequirements`: "Minimum cage 24\"W × 24\"D × 30\"H. Prefers width over height for horizontal movement. Needs multiple perches, foraging toys, and climbing opportunities. Play gym recommended for out-of-cage time."
- `timeCommitment`: "1.5-2 hours daily for play, training, and interaction. Daily food preparation (fresh vegetables) and cage spot-cleaning (15 min). Weekly deep cage clean (45 min). More demanding than budgies but less than larger parrots."

Ensure both files remain valid JSON. Match formatting style of cockatiel.json.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Three enhanced species profiles with rich care data showcasing new schema capabilities</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run: npm run dev
2. Visit English species pages:
   - http://localhost:4321/species/cockatiel
   - http://localhost:4321/species/blue-and-gold-macaw
   - http://localhost:4321/species/green-cheeked-conure
3. Check that all three pages load without errors
4. Verify new content fields appear correctly (if template displays them)
5. Note: New fields may not display yet if page templates haven't been updated - that's expected
6. Confirm no JavaScript console errors
7. Check that enhanced content quality sets proper standard (realistic, detailed, practical)
8. Verify Spanish pages also build: /es/species/[slug]

Quality check:
- Information is specific and actionable (not vague)
- Care level matches species difficulty accurately
- Time commitments are realistic
- Space requirements are practical and measurable
- Content establishes "best on the web" quality standard
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if enhanced species demonstrate quality standard, or describe any content issues to address</resume-signal>
