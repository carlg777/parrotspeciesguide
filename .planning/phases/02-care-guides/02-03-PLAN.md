**Tech stack available:**
- Guides collection with bilingual schema
- Guide detail pages rendering markdown
- Category system (feeding, housing, health, training)

**Established patterns from previous plans:**
- Frontmatter with slug, title (en/es), description (en/es), category, order
- 5-7 paragraphs of substantive content
- Quality standard: specific measurements, realistic advice, safety warnings with WHY
- Markdown formatting (headings, lists, emphasis)

**Content quality checklist (from Phase 1):**
- Information is specific and actionable (not vague)
- Recommendations are realistic
- Safety warnings explain WHY
- Measurements included where relevant

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create health care guide</name>
  <files>src/content/guides/health-wellness.md</files>
  <action>
Create health guide at `src/content/guides/health-wellness.md`:

Frontmatter:
```yaml

slug: health-wellness
title:
  en: "Parrot Health & Wellness: Preventive Care Guide"
  es: "Salud y Bienestar del Loro: Guía de Cuidado Preventivo"
description:
  en: "Essential health monitoring, veterinary care, and disease prevention for your parrot."
  es: "Monitoreo de salud esencial, cuidado veterinario y prevención de enfermedades para tu loro."
category: health
order: 1
---
```

Content covering:
- Annual avian vet checkups (importance of specialized care, not general vets)
- Daily health monitoring signs (droppings, appetite, energy level, feather condition)
- Common health issues (respiratory infections, malnutrition, feather plucking causes)
- Emergency warning signs requiring immediate vet visit (labored breathing, bleeding, lethargy, etc.)
- Preventive care (UV lighting for vitamin D, humidity needs, sleep schedule)
- Quarantine protocols for new birds (30-day minimum, separate air space)

Include specific observations (e.g., "normal droppings have green/brown solid with white urates and clear liquid"). Explain WHY each health practice matters (e.g., "avian vets have specialized training in bird-specific diseases that general vets may miss").
  </action>
  <verify>`npm run build` succeeds. Health guide renders at `/guides/health-wellness/`. Content is medically sound and appropriately cautious (recommends vet care, doesn't diagnose).</verify>
  <done>Health guide created with evidence-based preventive care information. Appropriately disclaims that it's educational, not veterinary advice.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Create training guide</name>
  <files>src/content/guides/training-basics.md</files>
  <action>
Create training guide at `src/content/guides/training-basics.md`:

title:
  en: "Parrot Training Fundamentals: Positive Reinforcement Guide"
  es: "Fundamentos de Entrenamiento de Loros: Guía de Refuerzo Positivo"
description:
  en: "Science-based training techniques using positive reinforcement for building trust and teaching behaviors."
  es: "Técnicas de entrenamiento basadas en ciencia usando refuerzo positivo para construir confianza y enseñar comportamientos."
category: training
order: 1
---
```

Content covering:
- Positive reinforcement principles (reward desired behaviors, ignore unwanted ones)
- Trust-building foundation (step-up training, target training as first steps)
- Timing and consistency (immediate rewards, consistent cues)
- Common training goals (step-up, recall, harness training for outdoor safety)
- Avoiding punishment-based methods (WHY they damage trust and cause fear)
- Session duration and frequency (5-10 min sessions, 2-3x daily maximum)
- Clicker training optional tool (explanation of marker training)

Include specific techniques (e.g., "hold treat at chest level, say 'step up', gently press belly, immediately reward when foot lifts"). Emphasize patience: "Most behaviors take 2-4 weeks of daily practice to become reliable."
  </action>
  <verify>`npm run build` succeeds. Training guide renders at `/guides/training-basics/`. Content promotes ethical, science-based methods.</verify>
  <done>Training guide created with positive reinforcement focus. Methods are humane, realistic, and evidence-based.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Validate all four guides and build</name>
  <files>None (validation only)</files>
  <action>
Run full build and validation:
1. `npm run astro check` - TypeScript validation
2. `npm run build` - Full production build

Verify build output shows all 4 guides generated:
- feeding-basics
- housing-essentials
- health-wellness
- training-basics

Both English and Spanish versions (8 pages total). Check for 0 errors, 0 warnings.
  </action>
  <verify>Build succeeds completely. All 8 guide pages (4 topics × 2 languages) present in output. No errors or warnings.</verify>
  <done>Complete care guide library validated. All four core categories covered with quality content.</done>
